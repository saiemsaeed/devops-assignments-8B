## Project Details
### Description
As now a day’s people are quite busy in their daily work and it is extremely tough for anyone to manage their daily routine work along with some extra household works. So, a webapp is created to facilitate the user. General audience have many domestic tasks to be done other than routine tasks like renovation of house, an electric problem like malfunctioning of fan etc occurs people have to go out for the technicians, for repair which wastes a lot of the time. Besides if a person lives alone and he has to cook meal for himself, clean the house or wash the clothes as well this additional work would result in wastage of time and effort.
To overcome all these problems a system has been proposed which allows its user to select their desire need and worker with desirable amount so that one (worker) could go to one’s house to help him by fulfilling his/her need and earn money. Workers and Patron (normal user) want such a system to be established which offer repairing, cleaning, laundry, domestic working, babysitting, butler, nurse and driving.
