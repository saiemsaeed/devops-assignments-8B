## Project Details
### Description
  Notify Around is a location-based service provider, smartphone application whose purpose is to notify the people living in a community about what is going on around them.
  These notifications will be interest based and location based.
  It is n all-in-one platform that solves all the people's needs from taking their business idea to the most suitable area to having them engaged in what they're interested.
  Such a system will also help them in communicating with their neighbourhoods and town and being aware of all the sources and services around them.

### Technology Stack
  Android Studio as Development framework
  XML for Front-end 
  Kotlin for Backend
  Firebase Firestore as the Database

### Deployment or Distribution Strategy
  Because this is an android app, so it shall be released on the Google Playstore with Firebase database. 

### Architecture
 -The basic architecture of Notify Around is Model-View-Controller
 -Every component has its own model, views and controllers.
 -There are two main roles i.e. General User and Service Provider. Each of them have their own models for accessing nd modifying the database, their suitable views for user
 interaction and controllers for the communication between model and views.
 -For database access and modification, data classes in kotlin have been used.

### Target Users
 -A person newly moved to a place and wants to avail the services of that place and engage in the new society.
 -A person who opened a new business in a place and wants to amplify it to the suitable audience without having the need to distribute brochures etc.
 -A person that encounters a problem on his way and wants immediate help (e.g. car ran out of petrol)
 -A person who just wants to know what is going on in his town (e.g. new skills, events, problems, ads of businesses near him etc)
