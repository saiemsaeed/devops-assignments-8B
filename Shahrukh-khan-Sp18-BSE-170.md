## Project Details
### Description
  {Smart School is an IOT and AI based school management system that aims to automate most of the major and medium processes. The smart school provides the automated attendance system that uses RFID chip which is installed in each student’s and faculty’s ID cards. The security and identity of the students/teachers will be ensured through facial recognition. The Smart school has a uniform dress code detection system that uses image processing in order to detect any dress code violations and creates a report that is forwarded to the respective class teacher of the students. The smart school comes with a COVID-19 detection system that uses IR camera to detect elevated body temperature and helps the security in identifying the suspects. If a person has a fever or elevated body temperature, an alarm is generated, and the security can stop the person and do additional tests in order to further examine the suspect. There is also a visiting system that manages all the visits in the school.}
