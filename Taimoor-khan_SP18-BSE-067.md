## Project Details
### Description
In this age of modern technology, almost every service is being moved onto the internet. Where internet provides ease of access and convenience there are always some loop holes associated with every service. This is very much true for online shopping. Usual everyday products are easy to buy online and there is not much decision making involved. However clothing and footwear are a different story. Individually these products might look great but when you wear them, the end result doesn’t always pan out the way you hoped. This is where our application comes into play. Footgear makes use of image processing and augmented reality to help users in trying on different footwear products and see how they look on them.
