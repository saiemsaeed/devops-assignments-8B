## Project Details
“SSG Task Force” is a combination of three genres; Third-Person Shooter, Action, and interactive. Such a combination has not yet been designed. Interactive games give you a sense of personal space. We will offer the user a choice, how a better or a worse decision could have ended the event. Hack and Slash mechanism will also be offered in the game but the game offers the user a choice to choose violence or not. As the user progresses through each level making different choices the game will knit itself into a maze in which only the right choices will lead you to complete the game successfully. 

### Description
  Our proposed project is a TPS-Interactive Action-based game. The storyline revolves around an event that took place On May 7, following weeks of daily demonstrations and rising tensions between protesters, Israeli settlers, and police during the month of Ramadan, violence broke out at the al-Aqsa Mosque compound in Jerusalem, with Israeli police using stun grenades, rubber bullets, and water cannons in a clash with protestors that left hundreds of Palestinians wounded. We as Muslims have suffered a lot and we have lost a lot of precious lives. This game will highlight the efforts of our defense forces to eradicate Israeli from Palestine and this game will pay a small tribute to our defense forces.
The first step to solve this serious problem is to create awareness about such issue and for this purpose. We came up with an idea of a game that is to encourage this movement by making a 3rd person story-based survival 3D game on Unity3D.
The game will have a map of the local city of Palestine (Old City Of Jerusalem). Our game will have a character that will be a trained SSG commando and he will fight the terrorists in the sensitive areas.
Being a third-person TPS-Interactive action game, the player will be able to view the entire 3D environment. The player will be able to walk and run in all four directions, jump, collect assets such as first aid, weapons, or ammunition. Computer players (non-players) will have the ability to counter or attack.
