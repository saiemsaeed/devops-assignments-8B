## Project Details
### Description
  The purpose of this project is to make the purchase of medical Equipments for local businesses and hospitals more accessible, currently most businesses and hospitals buy their medical Equipments from out of the country either using Alibaba or their contacts, which take a lot of time and they usually get their Equipments in months which is not ideal. With our system in place local sellers can provide them the same Equipment within days and they can also provide them services in setting up those Equipments, with our system the whole process of buying medical equipment will be much more accessible for all, and that is why we want to make this project.
