## Project Details
### Description
The system is designed to provide a platform to the users who need to sell their services from 
home without worrying about limited job vacancies and will also help users to get their required 
services at home without stepping outside. The mission of Ears (Freelancing Service) is to 
provide a platform to entrepreneur, small businesses, and freelancers. The system is design in 
such a way that it will not only help local people to earn through it but also let people hire 
sellers to help them in their project to get it done on time and deliver to them whether online 
or through delivery. This platform is not only helpful to the people that have computer related 
knowledge or that have some expertise related to IT field but is also useful for the people that 
consume other talents as well (skills based on their work experience or skills without degree in 
specific field). This system is also intended to make the process of buying and selling service 
easy for local freelancers. Proposed system would be accessible all across the Pakistan where its 
users would be promoted based on buyerâ€™s ratings. By using Ears (Freelancing Platform), users 
will be able to take the decisions with ease that in which category they want to start work as a 
seller.
