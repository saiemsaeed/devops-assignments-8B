## Project Details
### Description
The system is designed to provide a platform to the users who need to sell their services from 
home without worrying about limited job vacancies and will also help users to get their required 
services at home without stepping outside. The mission of Ears (Freelancing Service) is to 
provide a platform to entrepreneur, small businesses, and freelancers. The system is design in 
such a way that it will not only help local people to earn through it but also let people hire 
sellers to help them in their project to get it done on time and deliver to them whether online 
or through delivery. This platform is not only helpful to the people that have computer related 
knowledge or that have some expertise related to IT field but is also useful for the people that 
consume other talents as well (skills based on their work experience or skills without degree in 
specific field). This system is also intended to make the process of buying and selling service 
easy for local freelancers. Proposed system would be accessible all across the Pakistan where its 
users would be promoted based on buyer’s ratings. By using Ears (Freelancing Platform), users 
will be able to take the decisions with ease that in which category they want to start work as a 
seller.

 account of Buyer and after account creation the buyer can switch to seller mode and in Seller Mode after which the seller can create Gig to sell its service. 
 2. Moreover order management can communicate with Payment Module in a way that uswer first need to order a Gig to go to Payment screen to pay for the required Gig.
 3. The Admin Module is communicating with the user management module as it allows the user to report the seller and request for cancel order and in such cases the request 
 will be sent to Admin.
