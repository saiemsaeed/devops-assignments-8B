## Project Details
### Description
  My project, AR Based Education System, is an android application used to help young students learn various topics related to their studies in a more fun and interacive way. it will take advantage of the fact that young students learn faster if the learning proces is fun and feels more like playing a game rather than studying, by incorporaring modern AR technology.

### Technology Stack
  We will be using the following tools and technologies:
  =>Unity
  =>Blender
  =>ARCore
  =>Android Studio
  =>ReactJS
  =>ASP.net Core
  =>C#

### Deployment or Distribution Strategy
  I am going to upload the application to the Google Play Store and also visit schools to spread awareness regarding this specific modern technology and how the students can take advantage of it to help them in their studies.

### Target Users
 The target users for this project would be students of classes 6th and 7th, as they are the younger students that find it difficult to focus on their studies and would rather play games than go through the boring ordeal of memorizing their studies related to science.
