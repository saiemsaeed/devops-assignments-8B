## Project Details
### Description
Due to COVID-19 pandemic, it is indeed a hectic task for a working institution to keep check and balance on staffs and students in order to maintain social distancing and mask wearing within an institute. To overcome such problem, the project “Corona Prevention System” is proposed. This Proposed project will provide ease to the administrators in determining those students and staff members who are not following SOPs.
Major functionalities which will be fulfilled by this proposed project are detection of social distancing violation and identification of the person who is not wearing a mask and assigning a person to control the violations. 

Corona Prevention System (CPS) will provide the facility to detect the violation of SOPs in any part of building automatically by using CCTV cameras and applying computer vision and notify the management about the violators and violations along with the locations which could provide ease to the management in detection of violation and maintenance of SOPs in the institute. The proposed project is a fresh idea and hasn’t developed yet in Pakistan but there are some other applications (having slight similarities), providing social distancing and mask wearing reminder facility to an individual person, has been developed and available for the public use. As, the already developed systems do not contain any hardware involvement, they just provide the reminder facility to the user by using GPS Trackers, so according to that perspective our system would be little expensive. But as far as the institution, big buildings or organization is concerned, the proposed project would provide ease to them and reduce their expenditures. Before this system, one has to maintain a group of people at different location on a single floor of a building to invigilate the people in order to follow the SOPs which would increase the expense and staff requirement of the institute, but the proposed system with little expense (just for to arrange CCTV) would provide the services to examine the people, measure the distance between them to ensure the social distancing and check their faces to detect the masks using real-time computer vision and notify the management on the respected floor of the system where the SOPs are violated.
