 books which can get their attention as they have read similar books (same genre). This application will only provide recommendations about those books which are 
 feed in to this application, such as the genre for books as management sciences, mathematics, electrical engineering, biosciences, architecture, physics and for novels
 as thrill, comedy, horror, action etc. Only those users will be entertained who are registered in this application.
This application will first inspect all the books a reader has read in this application. Then it will go through all the books content. Some common words will
be detected in these books and then it will be compared with the other books in the application. Common books, that is the books having these common words, will be
extracted and will be list out. This list will be then provided to the user. 
In second step, the application will inspect the books of the other user of the application. If any 2 or more user show a common factor, that is they read the books 
having the common specific words, then those users will be marked as a similar group by the application and they can view the similar/mutual recommendations, that is one user
make like to read the book which was read by the user of the similar group.

 coded in python tkinter, the message/request will be send from this side, client tier, to the application server. When the user asks for the books
