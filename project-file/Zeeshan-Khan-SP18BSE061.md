### Description
  Trek Pakistan is a tourist application that will allow users to get the facilities of transportation, accommodation, food and guide all under one roof. It will allow tourist to plan trips to different locations or choose trips that have already been planned. It will guide the tourist properly about the destinations to visit and how all of this is going to be achieved. This document briefly describes the techniques that will be used in developing the system. The detailed use cases, functional and non-functional requirements and detailed description of different interfaces. It also provides an opportunity for business owners to promote their businesses (For example: Hotel owners). It will allow the tourists plan their trips to different locations or also select pre-planned trips.

### Technology Stack
  It is built on the worldâ€™s latest and one of the fastest growing platforms that is Flutter. The database used in this project is Firebase database which is one of the best platforms that store and sync data in real-time and it is also optimized for offline usage. 
  We use many other technologies that are integrated in the application like integrated APIs and like for Auto Tour Generation, we use Sentiment Analysis for searching the best places to suggest to the user.
  We are also using the latest tools for development, debugging and testing. We are using Android Studio, GitHub Desktop.


### Deployment or Distribution Strategy
  Front End will be deployed on the Google Play Store because it is an android application. Distribution tool will be Google Play Console to upload, manage and publish this application for users. It provides a wide range of configuration and testing features to provide users with suitable and best applications.

  The backend will be deployed using hashing services of Firebase.

### Architecture
  The Architectural style that our application reflects is Multi tier architecture that is Presentation, Business/application and data. The data tier stores information, the application tier handles logic and the presentation tier is a graphical user interface that communicates with the other two tiers. with the flutter front end being responsible for all the presentation tier activities, the Dart server side being responsible for application processing and finally the firebase database being responsible for the data management functions.
