Project Details
Description
{
LocatAlert, as the name suggest it is an alerting app based on locations that makes people alert about their daily tasks and activities that have been skipped out of the minds 
due to busy schedules or due to memory lapses. In todayâ€™s era, the use of mobile is very common and so the use of apps, so the idea is to create such an app that reminds people
about the tasks by locating at different areas. It is a location-based notifier. The user will be able to mark a location and once they are driving in that specific area, they 
would be alerted by app. For alerts you can setup various distance ranges. So that after covering up some distance it may alert you timely. Its alarming feature will help the 
user to perform the tasks efficiently just when he is close the place where the task is to be performed. In this way the app would be quite beneficial by organizing our life 
without activities being performed at a delay.
