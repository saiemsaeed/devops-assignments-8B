## Project Details
### Description
Our proposed system is a mobile application that will provide a freelancing marketplace platform for our local freelancers 
that have freedom to sell their services and help buyers to find people that can do their required services digitally or
can deliver the services to them at their doorstep. Sellers will create gigs(services they are offering) and buyer can
browse through the categories or use the search bar to find gigs of their interest. Buyer can look into the sellers profiles
as well as reviews and place order which will be completed by the seller in a required time.

  - Modules Communication
  user can create account as a buyer and become seller by creating seller account. 
  Thus user management will communicate with gig management by storing data of seller
  and create account of seller to switch between seller and buyer mode. Buyer can place
  order by paying for service and contact seller. Buyer will then rate seller on their 
  provided service.
  Userinterface will display data that will be retrieved from database to support 
  continuous communication between all modules.
