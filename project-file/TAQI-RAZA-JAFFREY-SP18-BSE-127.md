### Deployment or Distribution Strategy

Our system is deployed heroku both frontend and the backend.


### Architecture

System Architecture is basically a conceptual model that defines the structure, behavior and view of the system. It is formal representation of the system and provide infrastructure for the system. There is different architecture followed. 

techON will follow Client server architecture model at higher level. The upper layer in Server call database layer which will have all models that map to database. Next layer is service layer which hold all mean functionality. After that have controller layer which took request from client and delegate it to service layer. In parallel of these layers have DTOS (Data Transform Object) layer which proper map data from database.

DTOS gave only required data to controller which requested by client. Client architecture is a web-based application which will be used to interact with the backend and database.




### Target Users

Tergeted users will be the student and teacher.
