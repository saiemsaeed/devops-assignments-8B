## Project Details
### Description
School Van Transportation and Tracking system is an android and web application. The purpose of the proposed app is to provide safe and secure transportation to the students. To achieve this, a proper attendance and tracking feature will be introduced. When a student will get into the van, his/her attendance will be marked, and a notification will be sent to his/her parent. Parents can also track the real time location of the van. A proper maintenance procedure will be implemented to ensure the good condition of the vehicle and to avoid any unforeseen circumstances.

### Deployment or Distribution Strategy
  Playstore is used to deploy Android Applications(Driver and Student).
  We are using Firebase Realtime database for storing the data.
  We will be Heroku to deploy Node js Application because it is easy to deploy and provide ready to use environment and it also  free of cost.

### Architecture
 Our system has 3 main components:
  -Mobile Application
  -Node Js Server
  -Firebase
  
The Communication between the server is done Firebase Realtime Database through the protocol HTTPS. Firebase only respond to encrypted traffic so that data is safe.
Mobile Application Development uses firebase object to access and communicate with Firebase database.
