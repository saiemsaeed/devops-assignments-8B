## Project Details
### Description
  {Hall of Warriors is by genre a fighting game with 2 playing modes. One is Versus Mode and other is Story Mode. In Versus mode, letâ€™s suppose we have 8 characters in our game, we choose one of them for ourself and one for the PC, after choosing players we can play a match. We can also play through Bluetooth/Local Host with our friends.
In Story mode we will have one main character of our game whose story we will play.
}

### Technology Stack
  {We will use Incremental methodology for our project development. The reason for choosing this methodology is that incremental game development it combines the waterfall method with an iterative process. This means it can be used for working on smaller projects instead of using it for the entire project. The essential values of this methodology are its process and tools which means its interaction and the other one is its adaption to change. We are using Unity & Blender, Unity for game development and Blender for making or characters,arena design and for some modeling, c# is used for writing Scripts}

### Deployment or Distribution Strategy
  {We have not decided yet but we will use digital marketing for different platforms and this game is for android and android users can play on their mobiles and we will launch it on play store.}

### Architecture
 {
 Our game perspective is to provide players with a new Story of our main character and also in VERSUS Mode players will be able to enjoy gameplay through new character and an optimized gameplay.
 }

### Target Users
 {People who likes to play differnt fighting games for fun will be our customer. They will be people of young age and it also depends of our marketing strategy we use to get our audience.}
