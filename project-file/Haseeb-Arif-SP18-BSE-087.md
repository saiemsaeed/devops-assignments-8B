Project Details
Description
CMMI v2.0 Automated is a project quality assurance software. It combines project management, customer relationship (CRM), and reporting into an all-in-one solution. It allows users to control their business processes and workflow from a single platform, so they don't have to use multiple applications and switch between those applications. With a single software solution, we can control, and streamline the processes, with more time for creative work. 
This software is an improvement of the existing CMMI v1.3 system. With the release of CMMI v2.0 in March 2018, Agile was introduced into its workflow to improve performance and the time being taken to achieve business goals, therefore, leading to higher customer satisfaction.  
This software has the following modules:
1 Planning
2 Estimating
3 Monitor & Control 
4 Process Asset Development 
5 Configuration Management 
6 Supplier Agreement Management 
7 Technical Solution 
8 Product Integration 
9 Requirement Development Management 
10 Verification & Validation
11  Peer Reviews.
12. Process Quality Assurance

Technology Stack
Technology 
Mongodb,React,Express and Node (MERN STACK)
Tools
Visual studio code, Microsoft word,powerpoint and visio

Deployment or Distribution Strategy
The system will be deployed on the intranet of the organization through a series of nodes and routes with ports  

Architecture
This project utilizes the N-tier architecture which is used most commonly with web applications because of its ability to decompose the application into logical and physical layers. Each layer holds a specific responsibility and contains interfaces to communicate with the subsequent layer. The data flow between the layers is bi-directional, which means data can move back and forth between different layers to fulfil a request.
This architecture is also highly scalable since we can add additional application servers to the application layer. Due to the usage of Node.js for application layer, the single application server itself can cater to many requests at once.Since N-tier architecture is based on separation of concerns and modularity, the coupling between client and the server is low, and therefore, the system is easier to test, correct, maintain, and extend.
In this project, the application layer fetches data from the database and returns it as JSON. The use of JSON, nowadays, makes our application layer highly interoperable, allowing this web system to be replicated as mobile applications as well using nothing but the same application server.Any faults while the communication of data can be contained by the application layer, and be gracefully communicated to the Presentation layer. Therefore, making the system robust, contained, and reliable.
