## Project Details
### Description
Ride sharing is a service where people can share their riding sources. It has become very popular in developed countries, while this concept is not very popular. However, it     is very beneficial for developing countries. The ride-sharing system intends to minimize the usage of fuel and reduce traffic jams. Also, by such a system, we will reduce the   travelling expenses of users.
  In this mobile app, one who is about to drive can post a ride before sometime along with his starting and destination point. System estimates for cost by considering traffic     situation and distance.  So, the people who want to join in this route will request him for confirmation. The system also provides security to users; only users with a           verified    account can post and join the ride. Also, during the ride, there is an option to update your nominees with your current location, and also police and ambulance       call    option is available there to contact quickly
